# OpenPlatform Initiaive [v 0.1]

Let the ramblings begin.

What _is_ the OpenPlatform Initiative? Probably easier to start with what it is **_not_**...

The OpenPlatform Initiative (OPI) is not:  
- an _open-source club_ -- although we want to promote teamwork, collaborative efforts, and thinking big
- a software development cooperative -- although we promote collaboration and teamwork
- a software development company -- although we promote the works that our member developers produce
- TBD ...

So, OPI is concerned with the rights of the **Users**. The end user's privacy is as important as the works that **Developers** produce.

As we develop a specification, we will insist that developers ensure a high standard of security and data protection is maintained. Also, that no software contians back doors or tracking mechanisms which can be transferred or communicated to external bodies - governments, corporations, NGOs, etc.

In addition, the intellectual efforts of the developers is our biggest challenge. We will seek to ensure that licensing is productive for the rest of the development community, that developers are able to profit from their work while maintaining cooperative and collaborative efforts with other developers. The **_Initiative_** is interested in developing an environment where developers are able to access all the necessary tools to expand, learn, build, design, create, and profit.

The **_Initiative_** is also focused on Community - that is, developing social and commercial platforms with community policing. It will not be the desire or intent of the **_Initiative_** to act as an administrator of accounts, frameworks, platforms, or content.

Since the **_Initiative_** is concerned with providing developers the tool they need without licensing issues and restrictions from corporations, some useful tools might be development environments, graphics/drawing tools, compilers, editors, etc. These are generally fun (yet useful) projects developers can use to learn and expand their knowledge. For developers, we should see as much an environment of learning and teaching as we will collaboration and development. The **_Initiative_** is interested in developers of all levels being able to find something here. And, while creating a conducive, electric, and dynamic environment for creativity and development, it is imperative for users to recognize the **_Initiative_** as a top source for development talent, products, and services while focused on their privacy and rights.

Languages the **_Initiative_** is interested in promoting (because no corporation is going to claim licensing or copyrights):
- Assembler
- C (not C++)
- Python
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#P4)
- [Pike](https://pike.lysator.liu.se/)

Why not C++, C#, or Java? Because C++ can be muddled and made very proprietary which is against the instincts of the **_Initiative_**. Not to mention, Microsoft likes to claim C++ and I'm not a huge fan of that technocratic giant (lump Meta, Google, and _fill in the blank_ in there while you're at it). C#, because Microsoft. And no Java because, well, Oracle. That doesn't mean there won't be useful libraries or offerings in those languages. They typically will not be given top billing, though.

If we developed a new type of browser (why not a new protocol, too?), then we have a way to cut into all browser giants. Our selling point (well, even though it should be free) is absolute privacy, no cached data/cookies or identifying information. Period. Any feature with possible directed marketing will be an Opt-In requirement. Meaning, a customer must choose to opt-in to anything where their information could be shared. Part of the OPI would ideally enforce limitations on any ToS wherein users' information cannot be sold or transferred to any 3rd party, including other developers in the OPI.

Email me at thebadkraft@gmail.com if you're interested. This initiative is absolutely in its infancy ... barely that. Most of what I've got so far is simply some random musings and thoughts that jumble around in my head while I'm driving (I am a truck driver).
